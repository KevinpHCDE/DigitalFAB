            This was a productive assignment! </p>
            I 3d printed molds to cast silcone in to make molds to cast plaster in. It took me sustained effort to understand the meta-ness of the assignment. What needs to be a positive or a negative was hard done than said.
            It took more effort to actually produce. After the struggle lifted, I was able to enjoy this assignment and mess about with, paint, epoxy and casting wax into the molds.
            
            <p>Design question remained from last week: How can I make this struggle playful and trust the design process to enable something worthwile to immerge? How might I make something small enough that I can make mistakes and not run out of materials, (like the silicone and plaster), and have time to be to free to experiment and play?
                 This week is titled:<p><h2> "This is not a design class, this is an engineering class."</h2>

		\o 100mm/sec and layer height to .32. My printer kicked out 36 prints, one for each side of the cube for 6 lights. Each took about an hour.

		This is about prototyping small Vonorois to make shadows. I had to keep in mind that these bulbs run hot! The panels did cast shadows however the bulbs were too bright so the shadows were washed out. Also the bare halogen bulbs were harsh. Hmm, need a solution for that.

                  <p>I tried some molds filled with epoxy and wax. I had just enough Oomoo to make a wax candle mold using the Vonoroi Attractor from Parametric House.  </p>

I've relied heavily on ParametricHouse.com's Youtube videos to make Vonoroi patterns to cast dramatic shadows. I wanted to experiment with the pattern using a Voronoi Attractor definition.
