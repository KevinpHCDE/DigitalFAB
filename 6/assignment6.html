            This was a productive assignment! </p>
            I 3d printed molds to cast silicone in to make molds to cast plaster in. It took me sustained effort to understand the meta-ness of the assignment. What needs to be a positive or a negative was hard done than said.
            It took more effort to actually produce. After the struggle lifted, I was able to enjoy this assignment and mess about with, paint, epoxy and casting wax into the molds.
            
            <p>Design question remained from last week: How can I make this struggle playful and trust the design process to enable something worthwile to immerge? How might I make something small enough that I can make mistakes and not run out of materials, (like the silicone and plaster), and have time to be to free to experiment and play?
                 This week is titled:<p><h2> "This is not a design class, this is an engineering class."</h2>

		I had a hard time with figuring out how to make keys to align the molds. I decided to cast some silcone and see what happens then correct after physically seeing the molds.

                  <p>I started as a voltive holder, but I wanted to cast something rather than only have a 3d print. I tried some molds filled with epoxy and wax.  I had just enough Oomoo to make a two wax candle molds using the Vonoroi Attractor from Parametric House.  I made four candles and attempted 3 Moai figures candles. Each candle I placed a Vonoroi pattern. 
                      One pattern stuck out proud over the wax to leave dramtic shadows. THe Moai din't cast very well through the small sprues. </p>

      <p>
I've relied heavily on ParametricHouse.com's Youtube videos to make Vonoroi patterns to cast dramatic shadows. I wanted to experiment with the pattern using a Voronoi Attractor definition.
