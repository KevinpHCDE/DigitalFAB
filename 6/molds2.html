            My brain broke a little thinking about making molds of molds and casting them. Making the aligmnment keys for the molds was particularly challenging. At some point I stopped making it harder than it needed to be and went with an existing #d file of the Rapa Nui Island, (aka Easter Island) statues, called Moai.
        I've always had an affinity for the figures and the mystery surrounding them. It also seems a fitting artifact for looking forward into the future during this strange time. With Covid19, climate collapse and massive inequality, our time has shown a distinct lack of vision of how we want the world to become. 
        Or we have a vision and it sucks. Like the Rapa Nui, we are possibly in deinal of the future of our world. But here's some cool statues!   </p>

                <p>I leaned heavily on this Instructables tutorial on making a mold in Rhino. 
                The Silohette command helped the work flow but it still took a basic knowledge of Rhino, particularly not making open poly surfaces!

                <p>The silcone test prints didn't have matching keys. So I printed a sleeve to hold them together. The walls were also too thin to hold silcone so I taped them up. I also printed a key plate to make another set of molds.
