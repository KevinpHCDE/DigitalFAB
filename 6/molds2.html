            My brain broke a little thinking about making molds of molds and casting them. Making the aligmnment keys for the molds was particularly challenging. At some point I stopped m,aking it harder than it needed to be and went with an existing #d file of the Rapa Nui Island, (aka Easter Island) statues, called Moai.
        I've always had an affinity for the figures and the mystery surrounding them. It also seems a fitting artifact for looking forward into the future during this strange time. With Covid19, climate collapse and massive inequality, our time has shown a distinct lack of vision of how we want the world to become. 
        Or we have a vision and it sucks. Like the Rapa Nui, we are possibly in deinal of the future of our world. But here's some cool statues!   </p>

            <p> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printing-for-Two-Part-Silicone-Molds/"></a>I leaned heavily on this Instructables tutorial on making a mold in Rhino. The Silohette command helped the work flow but it still took a basci knoiwledge of not making open poly surfaces.

		Assignment 2 was getting started with simple prints! The hardest part was not rushing the process of getting the printer built, set up and calibrated.
