            <h1>Assignment 3: Getting started with Grasshopper!</h1>
            <p>The assignment was two parts. Part 1 was to make a construction kit. </p>
            <p> Here is the original image from www.atwoodtyos.com I used to convert into a SVG in illustrator, then the 3D prints.<p>
                My Grasshopper files took a back seat to trying to figure out printing calibration issues. These issues took up considerable time and patience.

            <p> Here's a :90sec video of stress testing to the clip design. This is where having little ones around gets fun.

            </p>Part 2 is to make at least three nested objects.

            <p>
                Here's the images of the first nested test prints for a retractable lightsaber and a retractable sword. For these I used STL files from John Mulac (https://www.thingiverse.com/3DPRINTINGWORLD/about) </p>
                <p>I attempted to print and after 20 hours had a failed lightsaber. So close! This will be 200mm closed but the nested sections of the light saber tubing extend to over 800mm. It appeared that adhesion failed from possibly not retracting or z hopping between layers.  
                    Notice the close up on the lightsaber hilt.
                    <img src="/3/hilt.jpg" width=200></a> <p>I tried changing numberous Cura settings to lose the "zits":<p>1. Retraction enabled</p>
                    <p>2. Retract at Layer Change </p>
                    <p>3. Z hop when retracted</p>
                    <p>4. Z hop height .02</p>
                    <p>5. Flow at 95%</p>
                    <p>6. Flow at 85%</p>
                    <p>7. Enable Coasting</p>
                    <p>8. Coasting speed 95%</p>
                    <p>9. Coasting speed 85%</p>  I used Reddit, and Ender 3 zit searches and tried any suggestion. I noticed the zits were forming when the nozzle was coming down or lifting off the print so I thought it was a over extruding issue that could be solved by coasting and flow. </p>

                <img src="/3/win.jpg" width=200></a></p>Finally got it tuned by enabling an outer wall wipe overlap of .5mm and putting z seam on front.

               I was able to mess around with Grasshopper using Jasper's tutorials as a base to print a 4 ring test. Here's the 3d model files.</p>
