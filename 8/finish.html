            I enjoyed doing the finishing work here. I was curious to see what the 3d print lines left from the molds would look like with paint. Though the molds and catings weren't perfect, I still found them adorable.  </p>

              Once masked off and rattle cans are out it is hard to stop. Just one more coat. Ok, one more. Some colors filled in the texture more than others.
