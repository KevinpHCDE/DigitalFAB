            <p>I made some upgrades so I could use different filaments. I was having adhesion problems with the TPU and PETG not sticking to the bed. 
              Also the flexible filament would bend or stretch in the sharp curve from the filament roll to the feeder assembly. Putting a metal assembly in and also adding an idler pulley would allow for smoother filament flow in the Bowden tube. 
              I used the bearing from the platic feeder and McGyvered it on with a clamp.

                <p>I put a glass bed on as well to get better adhesion at higher bed temperatures. I used glue stick because thge adhesion was too good.

                <p>
        The 1970's star filter effect on the flames is actually because my glass is broken on my phone from letting my kids play wit my phone and drop it on the sidewalk. I placed some of my prints in the wax molds to see if I could cast shadows.
