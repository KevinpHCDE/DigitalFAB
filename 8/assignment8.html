            This assignment was all about integration of all the new skills learned! What a rewarding class!  </p>
            I 3d printed molds from <a href="https://youtu.be/f5ssOHKA1rI">Duke Doks</a>to cast plaster in. I used Duke's STLs and the YouTube video as inspiration and guidance. I loved the variations on a theme that could make a light, candle and planter boxes.<p>
            From the the previous assignment with making molds and casting the Moai figures, I found that I enjoyed repeating the casting and painting process more than the software aspect.  
            Using Duke's STLs, instead of generating my own CAD designs took the pressure off the assignment and gave more time to produce more objects.
            More objects allowed me not to worry about any one failure. More objects allowed experience experimenting with new filaments, slicing settings, printer tuning, printer upgrades, plaster mixing, mold preparation and finishing paint.</p>
            
            
            <p>Design questions: How might I choose a final project that is ambitious in scope but is achievable with good planning? How can I produce a few prototypes for future gifts? What would be most satisfying to make and give?

		I had a hard time with figuring out how to make keys to align the molds. I decided to cast some silcone and see what happens then correct after physically seeing the molds.

                  <p>I started as a voltive holder, but I wanted to cast something rather than only have a 3d print. I tried some molds filled with epoxy and wax.  I had just enough Oomoo to make a two wax candle molds using the Vonoroi Attractor from Parametric House.  I made four candles and attempted 3 Moai figures candles. Each candle I placed a Vonoroi pattern. 
                      One pattern stuck out proud over the wax to leave dramtic shadows. THe Moai din't cast very well through the small sprues. </p>
