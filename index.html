            My name is Kevin Philbin! I'm an HCDE Master's student. I'm most excited about discursive and speculative design for imagining possible and alternative worlds. In this class, I'd like to stretch my conceptual wings and learn how to use 3d printing to make artifacts for better storytelling and product design.  <p>I come from a video background and would be delighted to help/teach others using video as a tool of design through story or documentation. </p> As you can see, I like swords and photobombing bands. I'm married to Laura, and have two kids, Seamus, 6 and Barrett 4. They probably want me to 3D print them Legos or light sabres. So that's cool since I like swords. And Legos.</p>
