            My name is Kevin Philbin! I'm an HCDE Master's student and excited to learn the following things in this class: how to be a real student, and how to change my name. Also I'd like to learn how to use 3d printing to make cool artifacts for better storytelling and product design. I'm most excited about discursive and speculative design. I come from a video background and would be delighted to help/teach others using video as a tool of design through story or documentation. I like to bike. As you can see, I like swords and photobombing bands. I'm married to Laura, and have two kids, Seamus, 6 and Barrett 4. They probably want me to 3D print them Legos or light sabres. So that's cool since I like swords. And Legos.<p>I</p>
