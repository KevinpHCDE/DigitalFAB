                My name is Kevin Philbin! I'm an HCDE Master's student. </p>I'm most excited about <b>discursive and speculative design</b> for imagining possible and alternative worlds. 
                In this class, I'd like to stretch my conceptual wings and learn how to use 3d printing to make artifacts for better storytelling and product design.  
                <p>I come from a video background creating commercial and documentary work.  If I can, I would like to assist others with using video as a tool of design that can show their work and tell their story. 
                    <p> As you can see, I like swords and photobombing bands. This band I met randomly at the temple on top of Mount Qincheng, Chendu, Sichuan Province, China. This is the birthplace of Taoism. I was in Sichuan for a video project covering China's National Parks and Panda protection. Aawwww!<p>
                        I'm married to Laura, and have two kids, Seamus, 6 and Barrett 4. They probably want me to 3D print them Legos or light sabres. So that's cool since I like swords. And Legos.</p>

                <p>
		Assignment 1 was to prep an image in Photoshop to vectorize in Illustrator, then add to Rhino and export a STL!

		Assignment 2 was getting started with simple prints! The hardest part was not rushing the process of getting the printer built, set up and calibrated.

          Assignment 3 was getting started with Grasshopper! Grasshopper parametrically manipulates Rhino files. The hardest part was to use the right commands in the right manner to achieve results.
