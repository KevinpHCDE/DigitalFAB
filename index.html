            My name is Kevin Philbin! I'm an HCDE Master's student and excited to learn the following things in this class: how to be a real student, and how to change my name. Also I'd like to learn how to use 3d printing to make cool artifacts for better storytelling and product design. I come from a video background. I like to bike. I'm married to Laura, and have two kids, Seamus, 6 and Barrett 4. They probably want me to 3D print them Legos or light sabres.
