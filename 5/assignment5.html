            Ran my printer non-stop! </p>
            At home during Covid-19, it is hard to focus uninterrupted for more than a few minutes at a time with family around.
            
            <p>Design questions: How can I make this struggle playful and trust the design process to enable something worthwile to immerge? How might I stop giving a fuck about being right/looking good/proving worthiness? 
                 This week is titled:<p><h2> "Head Down, Bum up"</h2>

                <p>
		So many prints! I made panels to soeed up the process. I jacked up my printer speed to 100mm/sec and layer height to .32. My printer kicked out 36 prints, one for each side of the cube for 6 lights. Each took about an hour.

                  <img src="bare.jpg" width=250></a>
                <p>
		This is about prototyping small Vonorois to make shadows. I had to keep in mind that these bulbs run hot! The panels did cast shadows however the bulbs were too bright so the shadows were washed out. Also the bare halogen bulbs were harsh. Hmm, need a solution for that.

                    <img src="bulb.jpg" width=250></a>
                  <p>
          To prototype modifying the harsh halogen light, I printed the thinnest print that wouldn't break when pulling of the print bed. 1mm is the thinnest I could print with success. I printed the existing panel with a solid circle to help difuse the light. The red color was an uninteded yet turned out to be a happy accident of string light going through 1mm if black PLA.
