            Ran my printer non-stop! </p>
            At home during Covid-19, it is hard to focus uninterrupted for more than a few minutes at a time with family around.
            
            <p>Design questions: How can I make this struggle playful and trust the design process to enable something worthwile to immerge? How might I stop giving a fuck about being right/looking good/proving worthiness?

		So many prints! I made panels to soeed up the process. I jacked up my printer speed to 100mm/sec and layer height to .32. It was cooking!

		This is about prototyping small Vonorois to make shadows. I followed along Youtube tutorials, pausing frequently to copy their moves. This still was aggravating, but once I could see my mistakes, I was able to start figuring it out.
