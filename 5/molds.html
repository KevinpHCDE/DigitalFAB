            I love and Hate Grasshopper. </p> 
            <p>I can't stop futzing around and getting frustrated. Grasshopper is breaking my brain. At the same time, it allows parametric manipulation. This mold assigmnet is also breaking my brain. I think I have it but no.

		Assignment 1 was to prep an image in Photoshop to vectorize in Illustrator, then add to Rhino and export a STL!

		Assignment 2 was getting started with simple prints! The hardest part was not rushing the process of getting the printer built, set up and calibrated.

          Assignment 3 was getting started with Grasshopper! Grasshopper parametrically manipulates Rhino files. The hardest part was to use the right commands in the right manner to achieve results.
