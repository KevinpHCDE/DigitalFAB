            This week was frustrating! </p>Grasshopper and Rhino are two different things that go well together, like peanut butter and chocolate, but it takes some effort. 
            I wanted to quit this class becasue I felt too stupid to figure out how to work with both programs. 
            This is where being in studio is easier to ask numerous small questions, or look over someone's shoulder. 
            At home during Covid-19, it is already hard to focus uninterrupted for more than a few minutes at a time with family around.
            
            <p>Design questions: How can I make this struggle playful and trust the design process to enable something worthwile to immerge? How might I stop giving a fuck about being right/looking good/proving worthiness? 
                 This week is titled:<p><h2> "How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Learned To Love The Process"</h2>

		This is taking STL and playing with the mesh to make prints! I played with thread STLs to figure out how to attach prints on to my kids' nightlights. Then I was about to print a bunch of tests quickly.

		This is about prototyping small Vonorois to make shadows. I followed along Youtube tutorials, pausing frequently to copy their moves. This still was aggravating, but once I could see my mistakes, I was able to start figuring it out.
