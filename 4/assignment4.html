            This week was frustrating! </p>Grasshopper and Rhino are two different things that go well together, like peanut butter and chocolate, but it takes some effort. 
            I wanted to quit this class becasue I felt too stupid top figure out how to work with both programs. 
            This is where being in studio is easier to ask numerous small questions, or look over someone's shoulder. 
            At home during Covid-19, it is already hard to focus uninterrupted for more than a few minutes at a time with family around.
            
            <p>Design questions: How can I make this struggle playful and trust the design process to enable something worthwile to immerge? How might I stop giving a fuck about being right/looking good/proving worthiness and stop worrying to learn to love the process?

		Assignment 1 was to prep an image in Photoshop to vectorize in Illustrator, then add to Rhino and export a STL!

		Assignment 2 was getting started with simple prints! The hardest part was not rushing the process of getting the printer built, set up and calibrated.

          Assignment 3 was getting started with Grasshopper! Grasshopper parametrically manipulates Rhino files. The hardest part was to use the right commands in the right manner to achieve results.
