            How to fail fast? </p> I needed a win or I felt like I wasn't going to make it to the end. I needed to think of how I could take small steps to advance but not get confused or overwhelmed. Nightlights worked well. They printed fast so I could test fit then test shadows. Clear glass lightbulbs cast harder shadows.

		Assignment 2 was getting started with simple prints! The hardest part was not rushing the process of getting the printer built, set up and calibrated.

          Assignment 3 was getting started with Grasshopper! Grasshopper parametrically manipulates Rhino files. The hardest part was to use the right commands in the right manner to achieve results.
