            I mucked about with other peoples' meshs, OPMs to quickly start printing tests. I was having such trouble with Rhino and Grasshopper that I thought it best to keep test prints moving. </p>
            <p> I chose to prototype nightlights because they could print in about an hour. One nightlight had a silicon compression coupling, so the threads would not have be exact. This would be an easy step to measure, adjust mesh, print and test. This kind of approach really helped propel me forward.

		Assignment 1 was to prep an image in Photoshop to vectorize in Illustrator, then add to Rhino and export a STL!

		Assignment 2 was getting started with simple prints! The hardest part was not rushing the process of getting the printer built, set up and calibrated.

          Assignment 3 was getting started with Grasshopper! Grasshopper parametrically manipulates Rhino files. The hardest part was to use the right commands in the right manner to achieve results.

  Assignment 4 was making progress in Grasshopper! Grasshopper made me sad. I almost gave up but then stuck with it.
