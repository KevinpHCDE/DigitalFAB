            I love and Hate IKEA. </p> I got a house full of it, but it is a bit cold, boring or generic. I've been meaning to hack IKEA stuff. Here's my chance! I wanted to modify the IKEA light fixture over my dining table to be unique and to make dramatic shadows over the wood grain.
            <p> A fun fact aside about the table: I built it from a slab from a round of 300 year old cedar tree that was discarded after logging in the 1900's and left to rot. We used a huge chain saw and Alaska jig. Cedar rots slow, especially a 10' diameter tree!
                The cedar round was reclaimed in the woods at Duthie Hill Mountain Bike Park. King County secured the land to build the park. I was invited to design a trail. It uses tons of reclaimed cedar that we used to make jumps, ladders and bridges. I hope to incorporate wood in my work somehow! I love the feel and smell and the satisfaction that comes from working with wood.

		Assignment 2 was getting started with simple prints! The hardest part was not rushing the process of getting the printer built, set up and calibrated.

          Assignment 3 was getting started with Grasshopper! Grasshopper parametrically manipulates Rhino files. The hardest part was to use the right commands in the right manner to achieve results.
