            I love and Hate IKEA. </p> I got a house full of it, but it is a bit cold, boring or generic. I've been meaning to hack IKEA stuff. Here's my chance!
            <p> I built a slab table from a round of 300 year old cedar tree that was discarded and left to rot. Cedar rots slow. 
                The cedar round was reclaimed in the woods at Duthie Hill Mountain Bike Park. My friends Simon and Justin had the original idea for a bike skills park. King County secured the land to build the park. I was invited to design a trail.

		Assignment 2 was getting started with simple prints! The hardest part was not rushing the process of getting the printer built, set up and calibrated.

          Assignment 3 was getting started with Grasshopper! Grasshopper parametrically manipulates Rhino files. The hardest part was to use the right commands in the right manner to achieve results.
