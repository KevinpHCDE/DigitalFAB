            My name is Kevin Philbin! I'm an HCDE Master's student. </p>I'm most excited about <em>discursive and speculative design</em> for imagining possible and alternative worlds. In this class, I'd like to stretch my conceptual wings and learn how to use 3d printing to make artifacts for better storytelling and product design.  
            <p>I come from a video background and would be delighted to help/teach others using video as a tool of design through story or documentation.

		Assignment 1 was to prep an image in Photoshop to vectorize in Illustrator, then add to Rhino and export a STL!

		Assignment 2 was getting started with simple prints! The hardest part was not rushing the process of getting the printer built, set up and calibrated.

          Assignment 3 was getting started with Grasshopper! Grasshopper parametrically manipulates Rhino files. The hardest part was to use the right commands in the right manner to achieve results.

  Assignment 4 was making progress in Grasshopper! Grasshopper made me sad. I almost gave up but then stuck with it.
